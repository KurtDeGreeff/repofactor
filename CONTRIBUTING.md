How to contribute
=================

We welcome patches to repofactor which fix bugs, improve documentation or
provide generally useful improvements and features.

We accept pull requests via github.com.

Contribution Licensing
---------------------

Since repofactor is distributed under the terms of the [Apache License, Version
2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), contributions that you
make to repofactor are licensed under the same terms. In order for us to be able
to accept your contributions, we will need explicit confirmation from you that
you are able and willing to provide them under these terms, and the mechanism we
use to do this is called a Developer's Certificate of Origin [DCO](DCO.md).
This is very similar to the process used by the Linux(R) kernel, Samba, and many
other major open source projects.

To participate under these terms, all that you must do is include a line like
the following as the last line of the commit message for each commit in your
contribution:

	Signed-off-by: Random J. Developer <random@developer.example.org>

You must use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms, and no anonymous
contributions).
